Rubik's Cube Scrambler in Typescript
====================================

This is a typescript version of the repo [jnrbsn/rubiks-cube-scrambler](https://github.com/jnrbsn/rubiks-cube-scrambler)

It was forked and written in Typescript in order to use it as part of [Chronocube app](https://github.com/pablopunk/chronocube), a software to manage Rubik's cube solves.

It works as well [in the browser](http://pablopunk.com/typescript-rubik-scrambler/), just like the old repo.
